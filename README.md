# Crash Course on Web Application Prototyping

## Overview
This course will be broken into 2 sections:

1. User Interface Design: The first 45 minutes will be an introduction to design principles and tools. We will cover

- A simple method that can be used to plan and design a web application. 
- Using Balsamiq to create an application mockup
- Using Invision to create an application prototype
- How The Iron Yard's Front End Engineering program can help you learn the skills to turn a prototype into a finished project.

2. Hands-on: The second portion will be a workshop in which you get your own web application prototype up and running.

Note: If you will participate in the second segment, please bring a laptop!
